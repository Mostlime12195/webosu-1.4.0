          The default keys are the left and right mouse buttons and the Z and X
          keys, which can be modified in the settings. The circles that appear
          on the game screen are called strike circles. When the circle outside
          the strike circle shrinks and falls just on the strike circle, click
          on the strike circle. Some circles have a slider that you need to hold
          down and follow as it moves. When a large disk appears on the screen,
          press and hold a button and quickly rotate your mouse around the
          center of the circle.

          <h2>The cursor movement seems to be delayed?</h2>
          Try enabling the hardware cursor in settings, which can reduce cursor
          input latency. However, in some operating systems or browsers,
          problems such as flickering or the inability to display the cursor may
          occur, so it is turned off by default. In addition, the cursor size
          adjustment of the current hardware cursor only has 3 fixed levels. The
          minimum value is displayed below 0.65, and the maximum value is
          displayed above 0.95.

          <h2>The game is stuck, what should I do?</h2>
          It may be that the browser itself consumes a large amount of
          resources, causing the lag, or it may be that some strange mechanism
          causes the browser to reduce the frequency of event sending. It is
          recommended to avoid excessive CPU usage, close anti-virus
          software/computer manager like Avast, try closing other tabs of the
          browser and restart the browser. Please make sure you are using a
          mainstream modern browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or MS Edge). If
          it's still stuck,

          <h2>Why is nothing displayed on the web page?</h2>
          It may be that the mirror site that provides the beats is bugged. You
          can look to see if there is no content on the homepage of the mirror
          site<a href="https://osu.sayobot.cn/home/new">Sayobot</a>
          . If so, you can contact the owner of the mirror site to restore it.
          Or contact us for it to be changed.

          This is planned for a later feature. At this moment, you can search
